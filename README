= I2C - Ruby I2C library 

== About

Interface to Linux I2C (a.k.a. TWI) implementations. Right now targeted at the 
Raspberry Pi, but should work with any linux i2c_dev I2C-hardware.

== Structure

The library is split into two parts: 
 - A backend for accessing the I2C bus (right now only through the i2c-dev 
   in Linux, other impementations are possible).
 - Drivers for I2C-enabled ICs. (Only for the Microchip MCP23017 16-bit
   IO-Expander).

== Installation

To use the i2c-dev backend it is necessary to load the "i2c-dev" linux
kernel module. This is not done automatically even if the module for the
underlying I2C-hardware is. 
Also the device file (usually /dev/i2c-0) must be user accessible. A working
(at least on a RaspberryPi running Raspbian) udev rule file is available
(rules/88-i2c.rules).

== Acknowledgements

The low-level IO (mainly in i2c-dev.rb) was extracted from Ruby-I2C 
(http://rubyforge.org/projects/i2c/) by Jonas Bähr <jonas.baehr@fs.ei.tum.de>
